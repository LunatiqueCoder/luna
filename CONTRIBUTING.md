# Contributing

Contributing to this project should be as easy and transparent as possible.

## Workflow

We use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/), so all code changes happen through pull requests.

1.  Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`.
2.  If you've changed the functionality, update the documentation.
3.  Issue that pull request! :tada:
