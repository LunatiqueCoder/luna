## 🏃🏻‍♂️ Running the app

- ### 💻   **Web**
#### `yarn web`

Runs the app in the web in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000][25] to view it in the browser.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the web app for production with Next.js. 

#### `yarn next-start`

Runs the web app in production mode with Next.js. \
Open [http://localhost:3000][25] to view it in the browser. \
**Note:** You have to run `yarn build` first!

- ### 📱  **Native**

#### `yarn start`

Start Metro Bundler. After that, you can press "i" or "a" to run the app on iOS or Android simulator respectively.


## 🧰 Development Tools
- [React Dev Tools][27] supports inspecting and editing of React Native styles. It’s recommended that you rely more on React Dev Tools and live/hot-reloading rather than inspecting and editing the **DOM** directly.
-  Check your code style with `yarn lint:all` (runs eslint, prettier, and tsc)
- Check your code correctness with `yarn test:all` (runs jest)
