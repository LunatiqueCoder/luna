# üåí `Luna`
### `üåí Luna` is a `React Native` and `Next.js` boilerplate so your app can run on `Android`, `IOS` and `Web` concurrently.
[You can try the live example here.][19]

## ‚≠ê Features
> üìñ Please visit the [`üåí Luna Wiki`][20] to see why and how we decided to implement all those features. \
> üöÄ For an advanced start, but currently without `Next.js`, you can head to [react-native-firebase-authentification-example][21] which is built on top of Luna template

- [React Native Web][22]
- [Next.js][6]
- [Tamagui][29]
- [Solito][23]
- [TypeScript][24]
- Other

## üéõ Setup
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please be sure your environment is set up correctly for React Native CLI. \
> üîó https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup 

## üõ∏ Usage

<pre>npx react-native init <b>MyAppName</b> --template @criszz77/luna</pre>

Use the above command to start a new React Native app using this template. After that, all the commands from below are available:

- ### üíª   **Web**
#### `yarn web`

Runs the app in the web in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000][25] to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `yarn build`

Builds the web app for production with Next.js. 

#### `yarn next-start`

Runs the web app in production mode with Next.js. \
Open [http://localhost:3000][25] to view it in the browser. \
**Note:** You have to run `yarn build` first!

- ### üì±  **Native**

#### `yarn start`

Start Metro Bundler.


#### `yarn android`

Launches the app for Android in debug mode.

#### `yarn ios`

Launches the app for IOS in debug mode.

## ü™≤ Debugging
- ### React Native CLI
> This template only works with the new CLI. Please make sure that: 
> - [your environment is set up correctly for React Native CLI.][26]
> - you have uninstalled the legacy `react-native-cli` first (`npm uninstall -g react-native-cli`) for the below command to work. If you wish to not use npx, you can also install the new CLI globally (`npm i -g @react-native-community/cli` or `yarn global add @react-native-community/cli`).

> If you tried the above and still get the @criszz77/luna: Not found error, please try adding the `--ignore-existing` flag to force npx to ignore any locally installed versions of the CLI and use the latest.
Further information can be found here: https://github.com/react-native-community/cli#about 

- ### React Native Web
> [React Dev Tools][27] supports inspecting and editing of React Native styles. It‚Äôs recommended that you rely more on React Dev Tools and live/hot-reloading rather than inspecting and editing the **DOM** directly.
