# 🌒 `Luna`
### `🌒 Luna` is a `React Native` boilerplate with minimal configuration so your app can run on `Android`, `IOS` and `Web` concurrently.

## ⭐ Features:
- [React Native Web](https://necolas.github.io/react-native-web/)
- [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) 
- [React Native Elements](https://reactnativeelements.com/)

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Other

## 🛸 Usage
> ⚠️ [Please be sure your environment is set up correctly for React Native CLI.](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) \
> 🔗 https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

<pre>npx react-native init <b>MyAppName</b> --template plaut-ro/luna</pre>

Use the above command to start a new React Native app using this template. After that, all the commands from below are available:

### `npm run web`

Runs the app in the web.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run start`

Start Metro Bundler.

### `npm run android`

Launches the app for Android in debug mode.

### `npm run ios`

Launches the app for IOS in debug mode.

## 🐛 Debugging
- ### React Native CLI
> This template only works with the new CLI. Please make sure that: 
> - [your environment is set up correctly for React Native CLI.](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
> - you have uninstalled the legacy `react-native-cli` first (`npm uninstall -g react-native-cli`) for the below command to work. If you wish to not use npx, you can also install the new CLI globally (`npm i -g @react-native-community/cli` or `yarn global add @react-native-community/cli`).

> If you tried the above and still get the @notorious112/luna: Not found error, please try adding the `--ignore-existing` flag to force npx to ignore any locally installed versions of the CLI and use the latest.
