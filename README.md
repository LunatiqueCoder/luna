## ⚠️ DANGER ZONE ⚠️
> ⚠️ [Please be sure your environment is set up correctly for React Native CLI.](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
- ### Work in progress
> 🚧 This template is currently under development, but we consider it stable.
- ### React Native CLI
> This template only works with the new CLI. Make sure you have uninstalled the legacy `react-native-cli` first (`npm uninstall -g react-native-cli`) for the below command to work. If you wish to not use npx, you can also install the new CLI globally (`npm i -g @react-native-community/cli` or `yarn global add @react-native-community/cli`).

> If you tried the above and still get the react-native-template-react- native-template-typescript: Not found error, please try adding the `--ignore-existing` flag to force npx to ignore any locally installed versions of the CLI and use the latest.
